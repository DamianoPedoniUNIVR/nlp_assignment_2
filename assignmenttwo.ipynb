        "The assignment consists in the development, in NLTK, OpenNLP, SketchEngine or GATE/Annie a pipeline that, starting from a text in input, in a given language (English, French, German and Italian are admissible) outputs the syntactic tree of the sentence itself, intended as a tree with root in S for sentence, and leaves on the tokens labelled with a single Part-of-speech. The generation of the tree can pass through one of the following models:\n",

        "PURE SYMBOLIC. The tree is generated by a LR analysis with CF LL2 grammar as a base. Candidates can assume the following:\n",

Candidate can either define a system by themselves or use a syntactic tree generation system that can be found on GitHub. Same happens for POS-tagging, where some of the above mentioned systems can be customized by existing techniques that are available in several fashions (including a pre-defined NLTK and OpenNLP libraries for POS-tagging and a module in GATE for the same purpose. Ambiguity should be blocked onto first admissible tree.\n"
